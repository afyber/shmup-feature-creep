# Shump: Feature Creep

---

Shmup: Feature Creep is a small 2D game engine project that I started like a month ago and have now decided to put on GitHub.

It is very unfinished.

### Compiling

If for some reason you have found this and actually want to try it here are your instructions:

This project was made with Java 17 and will almost certainly require it to run/compile.

The libraries in the `lib` folder (except for the javadoc libraries) should be added as libraries to your project (and be extracted into any JAR file), and the working folder should be set to `resources`.

### Licensing

This software is licenced under the BSD-2 Clause license, but I'm not paying a huge amount of attention to the copyright notices on this project since it's a personal project and a work-in-progress.
