# Shump: Feature Creep

---

Shmup: Feature Creep is a small 2D game engine project that I started like a month ago and have now decided to put on GitHub.

### Running

This project was built with Java 17 in mind and will almost certainly require it to run.

### Licensing

This software is licenced under the BSD-2 Clause license, but I'm not paying a huge amount of attention to the copyright notices on this project since it's a personal project and a WIP.
